# CodeClauseInternship_RoadLaneDetection
Golden-level project for CodeClause AI Internship – Road lane detection using Python and OpenCV
# Road Lane Detection by Processing Video

This is a golden-level computer vision project developed as part of my Artificial Intelligence Internship at CodeClause.

## 🛣️ Project Overview
The objective of this project is to detect road lanes in real-time video using computer vision techniques. The system uses Canny edge detection and the Hough Line Transform to identify lane lines and overlay them on each frame.

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV

## 📁 Files Included
- `lane_detection.py`: Python script to process video and detect lane lines
- `Project_Report.txt`: Full project documentation and learning outcomes

## ▶️ How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install opencv-python
```

2. **Add Input Video:**
Place a video named `road_video.mp4` in the same directory.

3. **Run the Script:**
```bash
python lane_detection.py
```

4. **Output:**
- Displays the video frame-by-frame with green lines marking detected lanes.
- Press `q` to exit the video window.

## ✨ Key Features
- Real-time frame-by-frame lane detection
- Region of interest masking
- Hough Line detection for lane estimation

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
- Real-time video processing
- Image transformation and masking
- Edge detection and line approximation with OpenCV
